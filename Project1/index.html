          <h2>Founder Of Pakistan</h2>
          <p>
            Father of the Nation
            <b>Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah's</b> achievement as the founder
            of Pakistan, dominates everything else he did in his long and
            crowded public life spanning some 42 years. Yet, by any standard,
            his was an eventful life, his personality multidimensional and his
            achievements in other fields were many, if not equally great.
            Indeed, several were the roles he had played with distinction: at
            one time or another, he was one of the greatest legal luminaries
            India had produced during the first half of the century, an
            `ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity, a great constitutionalist, a
            distinguished parliamentarian, a top-notch politician, an
            indefatigable freedom-fighter, a dynamic Muslim leader, a political
            strategist and, above all one of the great nation-builders of modern
            times. What, however, makes him so remarkable is the fact that while
            similar other leaders assumed the leadership of traditionally
            well-defined nations and espoused their cause, or led them to
            freedom, he created a nation out of an inchoate and down-trodden
            minority and established a cultural and national home for it. And
            all that within a decade. For over three decades before the
            successful culmination in 1947, of the Muslim struggle for freedom
            in the South-Asian subcontinent, Jinnah had provided political
            leadership to the Indian Muslims: initially as one of the leaders,
            but later, since 1947, as the only prominent leader- the
            Quaid-i-Azam. For over thirty years, he had guided their affairs; he
            had given expression, coherence and direction to their legitimate
            aspirations and cherished dreams; he had formulated these into
            concrete demands; and, above all, he had striven all the while to
            get them conceded by both the ruling British and the numerous Hindus
            the dominant segment of India's population. And for over thirty
            years he had fought, relentlessly and inexorably, for the inherent
            rights of the Muslims for an honorable existence in the
            subcontinent. Indeed, his life story constitutes, as it were, the
            story of the rebirth of the Muslims of the subcontinent and their
            spectacular rise to nationhood, phoenixlike.phoenixlike
